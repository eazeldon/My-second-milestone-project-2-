## Milestone web-project-2
This is my second site and my second milestone project during my studies at the
Code Institute. https://eazeldon.github.io/My-second-milestone-project-2-/

## Concept
This is a website for dream vacations.

The idea is to showcase interesting places and settings, e.g. snow, beaches, cities
as well as exiting and fun activities for families and couples.

Moreover, the site aims to share some information about Hotel accommodations and
choices of restaurants.

The target groups are families with children, lovebirds and honeymooners.

The design and UX idea, is to be comfortable and inviting while motivating the visitor
to take action. This was first illustrated in wireframes/storyboards/Mackups available
for viewing.

## Features & Technology

These are the features and technologies that appllied on the site

## Video-clip

I created a video clip with music and rotating images, l've cut a section of a song
using garage band and merged it wth the pictures creating a video file using Adobe
Lightroom. The pictures were prepared using Adobe Photoshop. Any resolution
issues stem from the original image and I have compressed it all to snsure minimum
space usage as well as a faster loading time for the viewer.

## Image layout

I created and edited the background image in adobe photoshop. Once you click a 
category of trip an area will emerge on top of the site background similar to a “light box” 
and it will contain additional images. All those images have been edited in photoshop as well
to make them fit for purpose.

## Music

The only use of music on this site is in the video clip mentioned earlier. It is a section 
of a song that was cut out using Apple’s Garage band.

## Code influence

In making the code I have taken inspiration from the Whiskey drop.

## Types of code used

I’ve used html, css, java script,

## APIs used

I have used Google Map’s API and imported an interactive google map to the site 
where you can scroll the world and also get images by dragging the “google man” on 
to the map in the area of interest.

## Colors

I choose a color scheme for the buttons that will work well together without forcefully 
sticking out. In my mind the colors fit the destination as well. The main picture of the 
site was picked for its’ color and the ability to both be interesting, exciting and 
calming all at once.

## Testing notes

I've tested the website in Chrome and Safari as well as the screen sizes in Cloud 9. 
All pages and all multimedia content worked well. I have worked on making it look ok 
on as many screen sizes as possible as well as on both Chrome and Safari. I have 
put priority on making the site look good on the cell phone since today it is the first 
point of contact for most people. Secondary screen priority is for various iPad/tablet 
screen sizes. Devices used in testing, Apple MacBook Pro, Apple iPad mini, Apple 
iPhone 6s, 7s. The site has also been tested on a Lenovo Thinkpad PC on using a chrome 
browser. There were no issues found. 

## Deployment

I used GitHub to deploy my project. The site is hosted using GitHub pages. The
deployed site will update automatically upon new commits to the master branch. I 
used the "git add." and "git commit -m "Finished index page, added CSS and other 
pages" to deploy the site. I have had a merge conflict and used "git merge --abort" 
and "git push --force" commands to address it.# My-second-milestone-project-2
